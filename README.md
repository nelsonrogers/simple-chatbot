# Welcome to my simple chatbot

This repo was created to showcase the deployment of a HuggingFace LLM in the form of a simple chatbot. This was a task I was assigned during one of my interview processes. I had never previously used HuggingFace, so it was a great learning opportunity for me as an MLOps engineer.

The app is available at the following address: https://peaks-chatbot-nelson.streamlit.app/
The hosting service is free, so the app may need waking up!

You can find all the documentation in the notebook in the root directory. Please note that the task prompt is in French but the rest is in English.
